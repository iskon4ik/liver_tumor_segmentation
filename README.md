## Liver tumor CT scan segmentation (STILL IN PROGRESS)
For now it's just a jupyter notebook with: 
- exploration of the initial dataset
- creation of new dataset of 2D images and their target masks
- defining Datasets and Dataloaders for our model
- defining UNET model
- experiments with very small sanity-check dataset on fresh new UNET model

TODO:
- refactor the code
- use pretrained ResNet layers UNET's encoder
- train it on the whole dataset of scans
